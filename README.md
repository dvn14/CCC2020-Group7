# CCC2020-Group7

We utilised the Melbourne Research Cloud (MRC) for our cloud service, which provides infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). For location-specific data, we gathered information from the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (will be referred to as AURIN).

In March 2020, the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) became a global pandemic, and many countries went into lockdown. Many users log or post about their daily activities on social media. This project covers our research on the analysis of what people of Australia are engaging in during lockdown. We targeted three main topics: food, film and exercise. This includes a development of a cloud computing solution to harvest, store and analyse tweets and finally presenting the data to support our research use case.
